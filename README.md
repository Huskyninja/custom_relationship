# Custom Relationships in Views Database Connector

Quick start module for creating custom relationships with Views Database Connector in with 
Drupal 8 Views.

## Details

The single function in this includes module is to connect different external databases brought into 
Drupal Views using Views Database Connector. It was built using information available on drupal.org's 
support forum and the readme file contained in the Views Database Connector module. The forum entry 
can be found at the following URL:

https://www.drupal.org/project/views_database_connector/issues/2487453

Because the information contained in these sources can be confusing, the author of this module is 
attempting to add clarification. If I had found somthing like this first when first working with 
Views Database Connector I would have saved myslelf a couple of hours.

This module is shared in the hope that it can assist you in your projects.
